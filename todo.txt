notes needs to use NoteSchedule
schedule can be deleted (after borrowing some of the code)
commands needs to be moved to the piano


loop method changes:
  - loop through notes and check the schedule
    - within checkSchedule() see if notes can be played as is or if they need
      to be modified
    - if they need to be modified, do it and add to commands
    - if they can be played as is, add to commands
    - if there is nothing to do, move on with no-op
  - loop through piano commands
    - play commands at specified time

MIDI callback changes:
  - handle note on callback through the piano
    - something like piano.handleNoteOn(midiId, velocity)
      - the handleNoteOn method will be responsible for looking up note and
        adding the correct info to the noteSchedule


processSchedule:
  - if there is no schedule
    - no-op
  - else if the delay has been reached
    - command the note
  - else
    - if there is only one scheduled event
      - no-op
    - else
      - check the first two scheduled events
        - if they have enough time
          - no-op
        - else
          - figure out what needs to be changed and command the note for the proper time
